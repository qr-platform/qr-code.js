# Using QRCode.js in Commercial Applications

This page explains how you can use the QRCode.js library in your commercial projects, based on our official license terms. Our goal is to make it clear what's possible and what's required when you're building applications intended to generate revenue or that are not open-source.

## What is Considered Commercial Use?

According to our license (Section 1), "Commercial Use" means:

1.  Using the QRCode.js library as part of an application or service that is intended to generate revenue or profit.
2.  Using the QRCode.js library in an application that is *not* an Open-Source Project (even if it doesn't directly generate revenue).

If your project falls into either of these categories, you are engaging in Commercial Use and you must purchase a valid Commercial License from QR-Platform.

## Requirement: A Valid Commercial License

**To use QRCode.js in any commercial application, you MUST purchase a valid Commercial License from QR-Platform.**

This is a key requirement (Section 2b and 3e of the license). Using the library for commercial purposes without this license is a violation of the terms and conditions.

## Benefits of a Commercial License

Purchasing a Commercial License grants you several key benefits (Section 2b and Section 4):

* **Full Rights for Commercial Integration:** You can legally install and use all features of the QRCode.js library artifact within your commercial applications.
* **Access to Source Code:** The Commercial License includes access to the complete source code of the QRCode.js library.
* **Full Support:** You are entitled to full support from the QR-Platform team. This includes direct support channels, priority response times, and assistance with integration and troubleshooting.

## Commercial License Fee

The standard Commercial License fee for QRCode.js is **$999 per year**. This annual fee grants you the rights and benefits outlined above for the duration of your subscription.

For **Enterprise Licensing**, which may include additional services such as dedicated training, integration assistance, or custom feature development, the fee may be higher. Please contact us directly to discuss your specific enterprise requirements and for a tailored quote.

## How to Get a Commercial License

You can obtain a Commercial License by:

1.  Visiting our official licensing page: [www.qr-platform.com/qr-code.js#license](http://www.qr-platform.com/qr-code.js#license)
2.  Contacting us directly via email: [support@qr-platform.com](mailto:support@qr-platform.com) or [qr.platform.com@gmail.com](mailto:qr.platform.com@gmail.com)


## Key Restrictions to Keep in Mind for Commercial Use

Even with a Commercial License, there are a few important restrictions (Section 3):

*  **No Standalone Resale or Distribution:** You cannot sell, rent, lease, or distribute the QRCode.js library itself as a standalone product. It must be integrated as an inseparable part of your larger application.
*  **No Reverse Engineering (of the artifact):** You cannot attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the provided software artifact. (Note: The Commercial License *does* grant you access to the source code, which you can then use and modify as per your license agreement).
*  **Proprietary Notices:** You must not remove or alter any copyright or proprietary notices included in the Software.
*  **No Competing Products:**
    * You **cannot** use the QRCode.js library or its source code to develop, market, or distribute a software library or a standalone commercial product/service whose main purpose is QR code generation, customization, or management if that product directly competes with the QRCode.js library itself or with QR-Platform's primary commercial services.
    * **However**, this **does not prevent** you from integrating QRCode.js into broader commercial applications that include QR code functionality as part of a larger feature set. The key is that your application should not be positioned or marketed primarily as a direct replacement for QR-Platform's core offerings.

## Integrating into Your Commercial Application

Once you have a valid Commercial License, you can integrate the QRCode.js library (including its artifact and, as provided, its source code) into your commercial "User Applications."
