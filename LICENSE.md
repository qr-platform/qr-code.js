This restriction does not prevent the integration of the Software into broader User Applications (including Open-Source Projects under Section 2a) that may include QR code functionality as part of a larger feature set, provided such User Applications are not being sold, positioned or marketed primarily as a direct replacement for QR-Platform's core offerings and services.
